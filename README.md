# simpleALU1bit

In this small scale project my goal was to learn how to implement a basic combinational Functional Unit (the Arithmetic-Logic Unit) in a RISC-V architecture using Vivado HDL.
The ALU I designed is very simplistic, it only caters for some of the functionality of a typical full-fledged ALU but it definitely has taught me a lot on not only programming through HDL but also utilizing a physical FPGA to create Functional Units, both sequential and combinational, to to eventually build an actual RISC-V Processor's architecture.

Learning Objectives:
1- Use Vivado 2019 Xilinx tool for synthesis and analysis of HDL designs
2- Hardware Description Language
3- Build and simulate digital circuits using Verilog
4- Implement digital circuits on FPGA kit (Nexys-A7)
Tools required:
Vivado 2019
FPGA kit (Nexys-A7)

The Nexys A7 board is a complete, ready-to-use digital circuit development platform based on the
latest Artix-7™ Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) from Xilinx®.
